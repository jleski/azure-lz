Hey there! Welcome to our Azure LZ repo. We've got everything you need to get your Azure environment set up like a pro.

## What's in the Box?

- Management Group Template deployments
- Permission scripts
- LZ best practices

## Management Group Template Deployment

Heads up: We're using Tenant level deployments here. You'll need some special access for this.

### Permissions You'll Need

If you don't want to go full Owner (and who does?), grab these roles:

- `Automation Job Operator` at tenant level (scope '/')
- `Management Group Contributor` at your top management group

### Quick Permission Setup

Here's a handy script to get you sorted:

```powershell:README.md
$PrincipalID = "<Your identity's object ID>"
$TopMGID = "<Your top management group ID>"
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $PrincipalID -Scope "/" -RoleDefinitionName "Automation Job Operator"
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $PrincipalID -Scope "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/$TopMGID" -RoleDefinitionName "Management Group Contributor"
```

## Let's Get This Party Started

2. Sort out your permissions

4. Deploy your Management Group structure
5. Explore the repo for more LZ goodies
