# Deploying a New Landing Zone to Azure

## 1. Define Landing Zone Requirements
- Identify organizational needs and compliance requirements
  - Example: HIPAA compliance for healthcare data, PCI DSS for financial transactions
- Determine resource organization (subscriptions, resource groups)
  - Example: Separate subscriptions for Dev, Test, and Prod environments; Resource groups for networking, storage, and compute
- Plan network architecture and connectivity
  - Example: Hub-and-spoke topology for centralized management and resource sharing

## 2. Prepare Azure Environment
- Set up Entra ID structure
  - Example: Create separate groups for developers, operations, and security teams
- Configure RBAC and access policies
  - Example: Create Entra groups for "Management Group Owners", "Management Group Contributors", and "Management Group Readers" for each level of the management group structure based on CAF (e.g., "Top-Level MG Owners", "Platform MG Contributors", "Landing Zone MG Readers")
- Establish naming conventions and tagging standards
  - Example: Use prefix "prod-" for production resources, "dev-" for development resources
  - Example: Tag all resources with "Department", "CostCenter", and "Environment" tags
  - Example: Resource naming: `{env}-{resource-type}-{app-name}-{instance}`
  - Example: Tagging: `Environment = Production, CostCenter = IT, Project = LandingZone`

## 3. Design and Configure Core Infrastructure
- Set up virtual networks and subnets
  - Example: Create a hub VNet (10.0.0.0/16) with subnets for gateway (10.0.1.0/24) and shared services (10.0.2.0/24)
- Configure network security groups and firewalls
  - Example: Implement NSG rules to allow inbound RDP on port 3389 only from trusted IP addresses
- Implement Azure Policy for governance and compliance
  - Example: Enforce tagging policy to require "CostCenter" tag on all resources
  - Example: Restrict VM sizes to approved list to control costs
  - Example: Ensure HTTPS traffic only for web apps
  - Example: Enforce SQL Server auditing to meet compliance requirements
  - Example: Require encryption for storage accounts
- Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs) to protect ingress traffic
  - Example: Create NSG for web tier allowing inbound traffic on ports 80 and 443 from internet
  - Example: Configure NSG for application tier allowing inbound traffic on port 8080 only from web tier subnet
  - Example: Set up NSG for database tier permitting inbound traffic on port 1433 only from application tier subnet
  - Example: Implement NSG for management subnet allowing RDP (3389) and SSH (22) only from approved admin IP ranges

## 4. Implement Identity and Access Management
- Configure Conditional Access policies
  - Example: Require multi-factor authentication for all users accessing Azure portal
  - Example: Block access from non-corporate devices for sensitive applications
- Implement Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
  - Example: Configure PIM for Contributor and Owner roles at Management Group level
    - Set up time-bound role activation for Contributor role (e.g., 4 hours)
    - Implement multi-factor authentication requirement for Owner role activation
    - Configure approval process for requesting Owner role at Management Group scope

## 5. Establish Monitoring and Security
- Set up Azure Monitor and Log Analytics
  - Example: Create a centralized Log Analytics workspace for all landing zones
  - Example: Configure Azure Monitor to collect and analyze telemetry data from all resources
- Implement Azure Policy for centralized audit trail logging
  - Example: Create and assign a policy to enforce diagnostic settings at subscription level
    - Policy definition: "Configure diagnostic settings for subscription to stream to a Log Analytics workspace"
    - Parameters: Set Log Analytics workspace ID
  - Example: Create and assign a policy to enforce diagnostic settings at resource group level
    - Policy definition: "Configure diagnostic settings for resource groups to stream to a Log Analytics workspace"
    - Parameters: Set Log Analytics workspace ID, enable all log categories
  - Example: Assign policies at management group level to ensure all subscriptions and resource groups are compliant

## 6. Deploy Shared Services
- Set up centralized management tools
- Implement automation and DevOps practices
- Deploy common services
- DNS services:
  - Public DNS:
    - Use Azure DNS for managing public domain names
    - Create a centralized DNS zone for the organization's primary domain
    - Delegate subdomains to separate DNS zones for different departments or applications
  - Private DNS:
    - Implement Azure Private DNS zones for internal name resolution
    - Create a private DNS zone for each virtual network or peered network group
    - Enable auto-registration for VMs in virtual networks
  - Use cases:
    - Public DNS for external-facing web applications and services
    - Private DNS for internal resources, dev/test environments, and non-public services
- Time synchronization:
  - Configure Azure VMs to use Azure's time sync service

## 7. Validate and Test
- Test connectivity and access controls
  - Example: Verify NSG rules by attempting connections between subnets
  - Example: Test Conditional Access policies by simulating logins from various devices and locations
- Validate monitoring and alerting
  - Example: Create test alerts in Azure Monitor and verify notification delivery
  - Example: Simulate resource issues (e.g., high CPU usage) to trigger automated responses

## 8. Document and Handover
- Create detailed documentation for the landing zone
  - Example: Develop a comprehensive architecture diagram showing all components and their relationships
  - Example: Write step-by-step guides for common administrative tasks and troubleshooting procedures
- Conduct knowledge transfer sessions
  - Example: Schedule hands-on training sessions for IT staff on Azure portal navigation and resource management
  - Example: Organize workshops to demonstrate security features and best practices implemented in the landing zone
- Establish ongoing support and maintenance processes
  - Example: Set up a ticketing system for tracking and resolving issues related to the landing zone
  - Example: Create a regular maintenance schedule for reviewing and updating policies, access controls, and security configurations

## 9. Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and update the landing zone
  - Example: Conduct quarterly audits of resource usage, costs, and performance metrics
  - Example: Implement automated compliance checks using Azure Policy and schedule monthly reviews
- Incorporate feedback and lessons learned
  - Example: Set up a feedback system for end-users and IT staff to report issues or suggest improvements
  - Example: Conduct post-incident reviews after any major outages or security events
- Stay updated with Azure best practices and new features
  - Example: Assign team members to follow Azure update announcements and attend Azure-focused conferences
  - Example: Set up a monthly meeting to discuss and evaluate new Azure features for potential implementation
- Optimize cost management
  - Example: Implement Azure Cost Management + Billing and set up budget alerts
  - Example: Regularly review and right-size resources based on usage patterns
- Enhance security posture
  - Example: Implement Azure Sentinel for advanced threat detection and response
  - Example: Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments of the landing zone
  - Example: Implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud and DevOps Security with security posture management
